termux-apt-repo
---------------

Script to create `Termux <https://termux.com>`__ package repos.

It can be used to publish cross-compiled packages created using the
`Termux build setup <https://github.com/termux/termux-packages>`__ or
with packages created (possibly on-device) with
`termux-create-package <https://github.com/termux/termux-create-package>`__.

Usage instructions
------------------

In Termux, install with ``packages install termux-apt-repo`` and execute
as:

::

    termux-apt-repo [-h] [--use-hard-links] input output [dist] [comp]
    
    positional arguments:
    input             folder where .deb files are located
    output            folder with repository tree
    dist              name of distribution folder. deb files are put into
                      output/dists/distribution/component/binary-$ARCH/
    comp              name of component folder. deb files are put into
                      output/dists/distribution/component/binary-$ARCH/

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help        show this help message and exit
    --use-hard-links  use hard links instead of copying deb files. Will not work
                      on an android device
    -s --sign         sign repo with GPG key

When using outside Termux (the script should work on most Linux
distributions), install with ``pip3 install termux-apt-repo``.

All the .deb files in the first directory will be published to a newly
created APT repository in the second directory (which will be deleted if
it exists, so take caution).

Publishing the generated folder
-------------------------------

The published folder can be made available at a publicly accessible
``$REPO_URL`` using any method:

1. By running termux-apt-repository on a web server directly.
2. Using rsync:
   ``rsync --delete -r <apt-repository-directory> your.host:path/to/folder``.
3. Creating a zip or tar file and unpacking it at a web server.
4. Any other creative way.

It can also be published using e.g. `GitHub
pages <https://pages.github.com/>`__.

Accessing the repository
------------------------

With the created ``<apt-repository-directory>`` available at
``$REPO_URL``, users can access repo by creating a file:

::

    $PREFIX/etc/apt/sources.list.d

containing the single line:

::

    deb [trusted=yes] $REPO_URL $dist $comp

``[trusted=yes]`` is needed if the repo has not been signed with a gpg key.
To sign it, pass ``--sign`` argument. The signing key then has to be imported by
the user to make apt trust it.
